                <article class="explanation" id="app-summary">
                    The Madlib Machine is an app that turns any text into a madlib by blanking out a given number of words and prompts users to fill them back in!
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>Enter text you wish to <em>madlibify</em>.</li>
                        <li>Enter how many <em>madlibifiable</em> words you would like to skip.<sup>1, 2</sup></li>
                        <li>The Machine returns a new text with various madlibifiable words replaced by their respective parts of speech</li>
                        <li>The Machine prompts you to enter replacement words for each removed word based on their parts of speech </li>
                        <li>Voila! You now have a silly madlib to share with everyone you know and/or don't know!</li>
                    </ol>

                <!-- Use this list to explain any machine/madlib jargon user might not understand -->

                    <ol class="foot-notes" id="glossary">
                        <li><sup>1</sup><strong> Madlibiable word</strong>: Any noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. This excludes words like "has," "is," etc.</li>
                        <li><sup>2</sup><strong> Skipper:</strong> The number of madlibifiable words you want the Machine to skip before blanking out another word.
                        A skipper of 0 would blank out every madlibifiable word; a skipper of a value equal or greater than the number of madlibifiable words contained within a given text would return the text unaltered.</li>

            <h3>What is a Madlib?</h3>
            <article class="explanation" id="explanation">
                Madlibs are pieces of texts (stories, articles, poems, whatever uses written words) in which
                various words are removed and replaced with blank spaces. These blank spaces are labeled with the part-of-speech
                of the words they replaced. Madlibbers are prompted to fill in the blank spaces with any word they can think of that represents that part of speech.
                <br>
                <br>
                This results in an absurd, often humorous variation of the original text.

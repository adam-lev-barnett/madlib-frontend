# Madlib Machine Front End
This is going to be the front end for my Madlib Machine (Spring Boot, Java). This will also be my first project using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, and Vite, so I'm learning as I go!

By completion of this project, I'll have a fully functioning web application that ingests any string input, replaces a specified number of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs, and allows users to replace them with their own submissions.
